# Exercise 1: Lists

# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
breakfast <- c("banana", "milk")

# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
lunch <- c("sandwich", "burrito")

# Create a list "meals" that has contains your `breakfast` and `lunch`
meals <- list(breakfast = breakfast, lunch = lunch)


# Add a "dinner" element to your "meals" list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$dinner <- c("hot dog", "burger", "ice cream", "cheesecake")

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals$dinner

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason)
meals[[5]]=meals$lunch

# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early.meals`
early.meals = list(meals[1:2])


### Bonus ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function
num.of.items.eatem <- lapply(meals, length)

# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal
AddPizza <- function(pizza){
  return(c(meals, "pizza"))
}

# Add pizza to every meal!
